# NVIDIA Display Controller

This is only for NVIDIA GPU's. You can enhance your display's visual quality and easily switch between different profiles without having to manually adjust settings each time. Applies to the monitor and not a specific program.

* Adjust the brightness, contrast, gamma, and digital vibrance settings to your preference.

* Save these settings as a profile to easily switch between different configurations.

* Set a profile as the default so no need to select each time.

* Optionally, set the default profiles to apply on all monitors at start across all displays.
  
* Minimizes to system tray to avoid clutter on taskbar.
